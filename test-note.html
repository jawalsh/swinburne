                           <div class="tei-p rendition-p first-tei-p"><span class="tei-hi rendition-sc">Once</span> only in my life I have seen the likeness of Victor Hugo’s genius. Crossing over when
                              a boy from Ostend, I had the fortune to be caught in midchannel by a thunderstorm
                              strong enough to delay the packet some three good hours over the due time. About midnight
                              the thundercloud was right overhead, fall of incessant sound and fire, lightening
                              and darkening so rapidly that it seemed to have life, and a delight in its life. At
                              the same hour the sky was clear to the west, and all along the sea-line there sprang
                              and sank as to music a restless dance or chase of summer lightnings across the lower
                              sky: a race and riot of lights, beautiful and rapid as a course of shining <span class="tei-placeName">Oceanides</span> along the tremulous floor of the sea. Eastward at the same moment the space of clear
                              sky was higher and wider, a splendid semicircle of too intense purity to be called
                              blue; it was of no colour nameable by man; and midway in it between the storm and
                              the sea hung the motionless full moon; Artemis watching with a serene splendour of
                              scorn the    battle of Titans and the revel of nymphs, from her stainless and Olympian
                              summit
                              of divine indifferent light Underneath and about us the sea was paved with flame;
                              the whole water trembled and hissed with phosphoric fire; even through the wind and
                              thunder I could hear the  crackling and sputtering of the water-sparks. In the same
                              heaven and in the same hour there shone at once the three contrasted glories, golden
                              and fiery and white, of moonlight and of the double lightnings, forked and sheet;
                              and under all this miraculous heaven lay a flaming floor of water.
                              </div>
                           
                           
                           <div class="tei-p rendition-p">That, in a most close and exact symbol, is the best possible definition I can give
                              of Victor Hugo’s genius. And the impression of that hour was upon me the impression
                              of his mind; physical, as it touched the nerves with a more vivid passion of pleasure
                              than music or wine; spiritual, as it exalted the spirit with the senses and above
                              them to the very svunmit of vision and delight. It is no fantastic similitude, but
                              an accurate likeness of two causes working to the same effect. There is nothing but
                              that delight like the delight given by some of his work. And it is because his recent
                              book has not seldom given it me again, that I have anything here to say of it.
                              </div>
                           
                           
                           <div class="tei-p rendition-p">It is a book to be rightly read, not by the lamplight of realism, but by the sunlight
                              of his imagination reflected upon. Only so shall we see it as it is, much less understand
                              it. The beauty it has, and the meaning, are ideal; and therefore cannot be impaired
                              by any want of realism. Error and violation of likelihood or fact which would damn
                              a work of <span class="tei-persName">Balzac’s</span> or of <span class="tei-persName">Thackeray’s</span> cannot   even lower or lessen the rank and value of a work like this. To put it away
                              because
                              it has not the great and precious qualities of their school, but those of a school
                              quite different, is just as wise as it would be on the other hand to assault the fame
                              of Bacon on the ground that he has not written in the manner of <span class="tei-persName">Shakespeare</span>; or <span class="tei-persName">Newton’s</span>, because he has not written like <span class="tei-persName">Milton</span>. This premised, I shall leave the dissection of names and the anatomy of probabilities
                              to the things of chatter and chuckle so well and scientifically defined long since
                              by <span class="tei-persName">Mr. Charles Reade</span> as “anonymuncules who go scribbling about;” there is never any lack of them; and
                              it will not greatly hurt the master poet of an age that they should shriek and titter,
                              cackle and hoot inaudibly behind his heel. It is not every demigod who is vulnerable
                              there.
                              </div> 
                           
                           
                           <div class="tei-p rendition-p">This book has in it, so to say, a certain elemental quality. It is great because it
                              deals greatly with great emotions. It is a play played out not by human characters
                              only; wind and sea, thunder and moonlight, have their parts too to fill. Nor is this
                              all; for it is itself a thing like these things, living as it were an elemental life.
                              It pierces and shakes the very roots of passion. It catches and bends the spirit as
                              Pallas caught Achilles and bent him by the hair. Were it not so, this would be no
                              child of the master’s; but so, as always, it is. Here too the birth-mark of the great
                              race is visible. 
                              </div> 
                           
                           
                           <div class="tei-p rendition-p">It is not, whatever it may seem, a novel or a study, historical or social. What touches
                              on life or manners we see to be accidental byplay as soon as we see what the book
                              is indeed; the story of the battle of a human spirit, first with Fate, then with the
                              old three subordinate enemies: the World, the Flesh, and the Devil. And here I will
                              say where the flaw,
                              as I think, lies; for, like other great things, a great book may have a flaw. The
                              Flesh and the Devil, <span class="tei-persName">Josiane</span> and <span class="tei-persName">Barkilphedro</span>, are perfect; the World is drawn wrong. And the reason is not far to seek. We all
                              brush daily against the Flesh and the Devil, we must all rub shoulders and shake hands
                              with them, and they are always much the same at root, only stronger and weaker with
                              this man than with that; therefore it needs only the hand of a great poet to paint
                              them greatly, after their true and very likeness. But the World is multiform. To paint
                              one aright of its many faces, you must have come close enough on that side to breathe
                              the breath of its mouth and see by the light of its eyes. No accumulation of fact
                              upon fact gleaned and laid up never so carefully will avail you instead. <span class="tei-persName">Titian</span> himself cannot paint without colours. Here we have canvass and easel duly made ready,
                              but the colours are not to be had. In other words, here are many curious and accurate
                              details painfully studied and stored up for use, but unhappily it is not seldom for
                              misuse. Here are many social facts rightly retailed and duly laid out side by side,
                              but no likeness of social life. Here are the <span class="tei-persName">Mohocks</span> of the day, for example, much as we find them in Swift; here is often visible even
                              a vexatious excess of labour in the research of small things; useless, because the
                              collector of them has never applied his spirit to the spirit of the time in which
                              these small things played in passing their small parts. He cannot, because that time
                              has no attraction for him on any one side to temper the repulsion he feels from another
                              side of it. Pure hate and scorn of an age or a people destroy the faculty of observation,
                              much more of description,
                              even in the historic mind; what then will they do in the poetic? Doubtless there has
                              been, as doubtless there is now, much that is hateful and contemptible in social matters,
                              English or other; much also, as certainly, that is admirable and thankworthy. Doubtless
                              too at one time and another there has been more visible evil and shameful than of
                              noble and good. But there can never have been a time of unmixed good or evil; and
                              he only who has felt the pulse of an age can tell, us how fast or slow its heart really
                              beat towards evil or towards good. A man who writes of a nation or a time, however
                              bad and base in the main, without any love for it, cannot write of it well. A great
                              English poetess has admirably said that a poet’s heart may be large enough to hold
                              two nations.

                               Victor Hugo’s, apart from its heroic love of man, a love matchless except by <span class="tei-persName">Shelley’s</span>, holds two nations especially close, two of the greatest; it has often been said
                              he is French and Spanish; that is, he loves France and Spain, the spirit of them attracts
                              his spirit; but he does not love England. There are great Englishmen whom no man has
                              praised more nobly than he: but the spirit of historic England has no attraction
                              for his. Hence, far more important than any passing errors of grotesque nomenclature
                              or misplaced detail,the spiritual and ingrained error of the book, seen only from
                              its social or historic side. We catch nowhere for a moment the note of English life
                              in the reign of Anne.

                              pleader for a country or a class, as one who will see no spot in England or nobility.
                              But indeed it is an abuse of words to say that England is governed or misgoverned
                              by her aristocracy. A republican, studying where to strike, should read better the
                              blazon on his enemy’s shield. “England,” I have heard it said, “is not ‘a despotism
                              tempered by epigrams,’ but a plutocracy modified by accidents.”

                           <div class="tei-p rendition-p">Enough now of the flaws and failures in this work; “enough, with over-measure.” We
                              have yet before us the splendour of its depths and heights. Entering the depths first,
                              we come upon the evil spirit of the place. <span class="tei-persName">Barkilphedro</span>, who plays here the part of devil, is a bastard begotten by Iago upon his sister,
                              <span class="tei-persName">Madame de Merteuil</span>: having something of both, but diminished and degraded; wanting, for instance, the
                              deep daemonic calm of their lifelong patience. He has too much inward heat of discontent,
                              too much fever and fire, to  know their perfect peace of spirit, the equable element
                              of their souls, the quiet
                              of mind in which they have and work out their work at leisure. He does not sin at
                              rest: there is somewhat of fume and fret in his wickedness. Theirs is the peace of
                              the devil, which passeth all understanding. He, though like them sinning for sin’s
                              sake and hating for the love of hatred, has yet a too distinct and positive quality
                              of definable evil. He is actually ungrateful, envious, felse. Of them we cannot say
                              that they are thus or thus; in them there is a purity and simplicity of sin, which
                              has no sensible components; which cannot be resolved by analysis into this evil quality
                              and that. <span class="tei-persName">Barkilphedro</span>, as his maker says with profound humour, “has his faults.” We fear that a sufficient
                              bribe might even tempt him into virtue for a moment, seduce him to soil by a passing
                              slip the virginity of vice. Nevertheless, as the evil spirit of envy rather than the
                              devil absolute, he is a strong spirit and worth study. The few chapters, full of fiery
                              eloquence and a passion bitter as blood, in which his evil soul is stripped and submitted
                              to vivisection, contain, if read aright, the best commentary ever written on Iago.
                              We see now at last, what no scholiast on <span class="tei-persName">Shakespeare</span> could show us, how the seed may be sown and watered which in season shall bring forth
                              so black a blossom, a poison so acrid and so sure.

                              the foot of an angel, and in act to bruise as of old the heel that bruises his head.
                              Only this time it is hardly an angel of light. Unconscious of her office as another
                              St Michael, the Angel of the Flesh treads under the unconquerable Devil. Seen but
                              once in full, the naked glory of the Titaness irradiates all one side of
                              the poem with excess and superflux of splendour.

                              poetic kingdom, there are strange superb inmates, bird and beast of various fur and
                              feather; but as yet there was nothing like this. <span class="tei-persName">Balzac</span>, working with other means, might have given us by dint of anxious anatomy some picture
                              of the virgin harlot. A marvellous study we should have had, one to bum into the brain
                              and brand the memory for ever; but rather a thing to admire than desire. The magnetism
                              of beauty, the effluence of attraction, he would not have given us. But now we have
                              her from the hands of a poet as well as student, new-blown and actual as a gathered
                              flower, in warm bloom of blood and breath, clothed with live colour, fair with significant
                              flesh, passionately palpable. This we see first and feel, and after this the spirit.
                              It is a strange beast that hides in this den of roses. Such have been however, and
                              must be. “We are all a little mad, beginning with Venus.” Her maker’s definition is
                              complete: “a possible <span class="tei-persName">Astarte</span> latent in an actual <span class="tei-persName">Diana</span>.” She is not merely spotless in body; she is perverse, not unclean; there is nothing
                              of foulness in the mystic rage of her desire. She is indeed “stainless and shameless;”
                              to be unclean is common, and her “divine depravity” will touch nothing common or unclean.
                              She has seven devils in her, and upon her not a fleck of filth. She has no more in
                              common with the lewd low hirelings of the baser school of realism than a creature
                              of the brothel and the street has in common with the <span class="tei-persName">Maenads</span> who rent in sunder the living limbs of <span class="tei-persName">Orpheus</span>. We seem to hear about her the beat and dash of the terrible timbrels, the music
                              that <span class="tei-persName">Æschylus</span> set to verse, the music that made mad, the upper notes of the psalm shrill and strong
                              as a sea-wind, the “bull-voiced” bellowing undersong of those dread choristers from
                              somewhere out of sight, the tempest of tambourines giving back thunder to the thunder

                              music,
                              each of us leaning back against the same cushion, under the purple awning of a golden
                              galley, in the midst of the infinite sweetnesses of the sea. Insult me. Beat me. Pay
                              me. Treat me like a street-walker. I adore you.”

                           <div class="tei-p rendition-p">The naturalism of all that is absolute; you hear the words pant and ring. Some might
                              doubt whether her wild citations of old stories that matched her case, her sudden
                              fantastic allusions to these at the very height of her frenzy, were as natural: I
                              think they are. The great poet had a right if it pleased him to give his modem <span class="tei-persName">Maenad</span> the thought and the tongue of a Sappho with the place and the caprice of a <span class="tei-persName">Cleopatra</span>. Such a pantheress might be such a poetess; then between fancy and fury we should
                              have our <span class="tei-persName">Bassarid</span> complete, only with silk for fox-skin. And this might be; for the type of spirit
                              can hardly be rare in any luxurious age. Perversity is the fruit of weariness as weariness
                              is the fruit of pleasure. <span class="tei-persName">Charles Baudelaire</span> has often set that theme to mystic music, but in a minor key: his sweet and subtle
                              lyrics were the prelude to this grand chorus of the master’s.

                              deep sky full of passing lights and dreams, and the deep sea full of the salt seed
                              of life; and among them Venus arising, the final and fatal flower of the mystic heaven
                              and the ravenous sea. Looking now from west to east, we may see the moon rise, a tender
                              tear-blinded moon, worn thin and pure, ardent and transparent.

                           <div class="tei-p rendition-p">A great poet can perfect his picture with strangely few  touches. We see <span class="tei-persName">Virgilia</span> as clearly as <span class="tei-persName">Imogen</span>; we see <span class="tei-persName">Dea</span> as clearly as <span class="tei-persName">Esmeralda</span>. Yet Imogen pervades the action of “<span class="tei-persName">Cymbeline</span>,” Virgilia hardly speaks in crossing the stage of “<span class="tei-persName">Coriolanus</span>.” It is not easy to write at all about the last chapters of the book; something divine
                              is there, impalpable and indefinable. I must steal the word I want; they are “written
                              as if in star-fire and immortal tears.” Or, to take Shakespeare’s words after Carlyle’s,
                              they are “most dearly sweet and bitter.” The pathos of <span class="tei-persName">Æschylus</span> is no more like <span class="tei-persName">Dante</span>’s, Dante’s no more like <span class="tei-persName">Shakespeare</span>’s, than any of these is like Hugo’s. Every master of pathos has a key of his own
                              to unlock the source of tears, or of that passionate and piteous pleasure which lies
                              above and under the region of tears. Some, like Dante, condense the whole agony of
                              a life into one exquisite and bitter drop of distilled pain. Others, like Shakespeare,
                              translate it pang by pang into a complete cadence and symphony of suffering. Between
                              <span class="tei-persName">Lear</span> and <span class="tei-persName">Ugolino</span> the balance can never be struck. <span class="tei-persName">Charles Lamb</span>, we may remember, spent hours on the debate with a friend who upheld Dante’s way
                              of work against Shakespeare’s. On which side we are to range the greatest poet of
                              our own age, there can be no moment of question. I am not sure that he has ever touched
                              the keys of sorrow with surer hand to deeper music than here. There is nothing in
                              his work of a more heavenly kind; yet, or it may be because, every word has in it
                              the vibration of earthly emotion; but through it rather than above, there grows and
                              pierces a note of divine tenderness, the very passion of pity that before this has
                              made wise men mad. Even more than the pathos of this dose, its purity and exaltation
                              are to be noted; nothing of common is there, nothing of
                              theatrical. And indeed it needed the supreme sweetness of Dea’s reappearance, a figure
                              translucent with divine death, a form of flesh that the light of heaven shines through
                              more and more as the bodily veil wears thinner and consumes, to close with music and
                              the luminous vision of a last comfort a book so full of the sound and shine of storm.
                              With the clamour and horror yet in our ears of that raging eloquence in which the
                              sufferer flings into the faces of prosperous men the very flame and hell-fire of his
                              suffering, it needed no less than this to leave the mind exalted and reconciled. But
                              this dew of heaven is enough to quench or allay the flames of any hell. There are
                              words of a sweetness unsurpassable, as these: “<span class="tei-quote" lang="fr">Tout cela s’en va, et il n’y aura plus de chansons.</span>” And upon all there dwells the measureless and nameless peace of night upon a still
                              sea. To this quiet we have been led through all the thunder and tumult of things fatal,
                              from the tempestuous overture of storm and whirlwind; from sea again to sea. There
                              is a divine and terrible harmony in this chorus of the play, secretly and strangely
                              sustained, yet so that on a full reading we feel it, though at first sight or hearing
                              it must be missed. 
                              </div>
                           
                           
                           <div class="tei-p rendition-p">Of the master’s unequalled power upon natural things, upon the elements we call inanimate,
                              knowing even less the laws of their life than of ours, there is happily no need, as
                              surely there are no words, to speak. Part of this power we may recognise as due to
                              the subtle and deep admixture of moral emotion and of human sentiment with the mysterious
                              action and passion of nature. Thus in “<span class="tei-title" lang="fr">Les Travailleurs de la Mer</span>” the wind and the sea gain strength and depth from the human figure set to fight
                              them; from the depth and strength of the incarnate spirit so doing and suffering.
                              Thus in this book there is a new sense and a new sublimity added to the tempest by
                              the remorse of men sinking at once under sin and storm, drowned under a double weight
                              of deeds and waves.

                           <div class="tei-p rendition-p">Not even in that other book is the supreme mastery of nature, the lordship of the
                              forces of things, more admirable and wonderful than throughout the first part of this.
                              He who could think to describe might think to rival it But of one point I cannot but
                              take note; there is nothing, even at the height of tragic horror, repellent, ugly,
                              hateful. It has been said there is, and will be said again; for how should there not
                              be distorted eyes and envious tongues in the world? Indeed a pieuvre is no pleasant
                              playfellow, the “tree of man’s making” bears a fearful fruit, the monstrous maidenhood
                              of <span class="tei-persName">Josiane</span> is no sister to the starry virginity of Dea; but how has the great poet handled these
                              things? The mutilation of a child’s face is a thing unbearable for thought to rest
                              on; but have we not seen first the face of a heroic soul? Far elsewhere than in the
                              work of our sovereign poet must we look for the horror which art will have none of,
                              which nature flings back with loathing in the bringer’s face. If not, we of this time
                              who love and serve his art should indeed be in a bad case. But upon this matter we
                              cannot permit the blind and nameless leaders of the nameless blind to decide for us.
                              Let the serious and candid student look again for himself and see. That “fight of
                              the dead with the dark” that swinging of carrion birds with the swing of the gibbeted
                              carrion, might have been so done into words as to beget
                              in us mere loathing; but how is it done here? The mighty manner of Victor Hugo has
                              given to this ghastly matter something even of a horrible charm, a shocking splendour
                              of effect. The rhythmic horror of the thing penetrates us not with loathing, but with
                              a tragic awe and terror as at a real piece of the wind’s work, an actual caprice of
                              the night’s, a portion of the tempest of things. So it is always; handle what he may,
                              the touch of a great poet will leave upon it a spell to consume and transmute whatever
                              a weaker touch would leave in it of repulsive. 
                              </div>
                           
                           
                           <div class="tei-p rendition-p">Whether or not we are now speaking of a great poet, of a name imperishable, is not
                              a question which can be gravely deliberated. I have only to record my own poor conviction,
                              based on some study and comparison of the men, that precisely as we now think of those
                              judges who put <span class="tei-persName">Fletcher</span> above Shakespeare, <span class="tei-persName">Cowley</span> above Milton, the paid poets of <span class="tei-persName">Richelieu</span> beside <span class="tei-persName">Comeille</span>, and I know not whom beside <span class="tei-persName">Moliere</span>, will the future think of those judges who would place any poet of his age by the
                              side of Victor Hugo. Nor has his age proved poor—it has rather been singularly rich—in
                              men and in poets really and greatly admirable. But even had another done as well once
                              and again as the master himself, who has done so well as much? Had he done but half,
                              had he done but a tenth of his actual work, his supremacy, being less incontestable,
                              would no doubt have been less contested. A parsimonious poet calculates well for his
                              own time. Had Victor Hugo granted us but one great play— say “Marion de Lorme,” but
                              one great lyric work— say “<span class="tei-title" lang="fr">Les Contemplations</span>,” but one great tragic story—say any one you please, the temptation to decry or denounce
                              him by comparison would have been less; for with the tribe of Barkilphedro the strength
                              of this temptation grows with the growth of the benefit conferred. And very potent
                              is that tribe in the world of men and of letters. 
                              </div>
                           
                           
                           <div class="tei-p rendition-p">As for me, I am not careful to praise or dispraise by comparison at all. I am not
                              curious to enquire what of apparent or of actual truth there may be in any charge
                              brought against the doer of the greatest things done, the giver of the greatest gifts
                              given among men in our times. Goethe found his way of work mechanical and theatrical;
                              Milton also lived to make oblique recantation of his early praise of Shakespeare;
                              we may, and should, wish this otherwise: yet none the less are they all great men.
                              It may be there is perceptible in Victor Hugo something too much of positive intention,
                              of prepense application, of composition and forethought: what if there were? One question
                              stands forth first and last; is the work done good work and great, or not? A lesser
                              question is this; these that we find to be faults, are they qualities separable from
                              the man’s nature? could we have his work without them? If not, and if his work be
                              great, what will it profit us to blame them or to regret? First, at all events, let
                              us have the sense to enjoy it and the grace to give thanks. What for example if there
                              be in this book we have spoken of errors of language, errors historical or social?
                              Has it not throughout a mighty hold upon men and things, the godlike strength of grasp
                              which only a great man can have of them? And for quiet power of hand, for scornful
                              sureness of satiric truth, what can exceed his study of the  queen of England (Anne)?
                              Has it not been steeped in the tears and the fire of live
                              emotion? If the style be overcharged and overshining with bright sharp strokes and
                              points, these are no fireworks of any mechanic’s fashion: these are the phosphoric
                              flashes of the sea-fire moving on the depth of the limitless and living sea. Enough,
                              that the book is great and heroic, tender and strong; full from end to end of divine
                              and passionate love, of holy and ardent pity for men that suffer wrong at the hands
                              of men; full, not less, of lyric loveliness and lyric force; and I for one am content
                              to be simply glad and grateful: content in that simplicity of spirit to accept it
                              as one more benefit at the hands of the supreme singer now living among us the beautiful
                              and lofty life of one loving the race of men he serves, and of them in all time to
                              be beloved.
