                    <p><hi rendition="#sc">[Prefatory Note.</hi>—This, like the following essay, was prefixed to a small volume of selections from the poems of the author whose genius is the subject of discussion. To the work of <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Coleridge</persName> this process of selection, if adequately carried out, must have been, as <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Leigh Hunt</persName> long since suggested, a real and great service; for his work is distinctly divisible into good and bad, durable and perishable; and it would be a clear gain to have the priceless parts of that work detached from the worthless; but to Byron, who rarely wrote anything either worthless or faultless, it could not be otherwise than injurious. He can only be judged or appreciated in the mass; the greatest of his works was his whole work taken altogether; and to know or to honour him aright he must be considered with all his imperfections and with all his glories on his head.]</p>
                    <p><hi rendition="#sc">The</hi> most delicate and thoughtful of English critics has charged the present generation of Englishmen with forgetfulness of Byron. It is not a light charge: and it is not ungrounded. Men born when this century was getting into its forties were baptized into another church <pb n="239"/>  than his with the rites of another creed. Upon their ears, first after the cadences of elder poets, fell the faultless and fervent melodies of <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Tennyson</persName>. To them, chief among the past heroes of the younger century, three men appeared as predominant in poetry; <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Coleridge</persName>, <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Keats</persName>, and <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Shelley</persName>. Behind these were effaced, on either hand, the two great opposing figures of Byron and <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Wordsworth</persName>. No man under twenty can just now be expected to appreciate these. The time was when all boys and girls who paddled in rhyme and dabbled in sentiment were wont to adore the presence or the memory of Byron with foolish faces of praise. It is of little moment to him or to us that they have long since ceased to cackle and begun to hiss. They have become used to better verse and carefuller workmen; and must be forgiven if after such training they cannot at once appreciate the splendid and imperishable excellence which covers all his offences and outweighs all his defects: the excellence of sincerity and strength. Without these no poet can live; but few have ever had so much of them as Byron. His sincerity indeed is difficult to discover and define; but it does in effect lie at the root of all his good works: deformed by pretension and defaced by assumption, masked by folly and veiled by affectation; but perceptible after all, and priceless.</p>
            <p>It is no part of my present office to rewrite the history of a life in which every date and event that could be given would now seem trite and stale to all possible readers. If, after so many promises and hints, something at once new and true shall at length be unearthed <!--as fw does not change from here on, not updating per guidelines-->or extricated, which may affect for the better or the worse our judgment of the man, it will be possible and necessary to rewrite it Meantime this among other chances “lies on the lap of the gods;“and especially on the lap of a goddess who still treads our earth. Until she speaks, we cannot guess what she may have to say; and can only pass by with reverent or with sceptical reticence. <note n="1">It will be evident that these lines were written before the appearance of the book in which <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Madame de Boissy</persName> thought fit to let the world know that she had nothing to tell worth its hearing with regard to the man whose love had made her famous, but was not the less willing to put forth that nothing in two leaden volumes of verbiage. The worst consequence of this miscarriage was not the collapse of such faint hopes or surmises as we might yet have cherished of some benefit to be received in the way of biography, some new and kindly light to be thrown on the life and character of <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Byron</persName>; it was the opportunity given to a filthy female moralist and novelist who was not slow to avail herself of such an occasion “to expound her beastly mind to all.” Evidently the laurels of <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Mrs. Behn</persName> had long kept her successor from sleeping; it was not enough to have copied the authoress of “<title>Oroonoko</title>” in the selection of a sable and a servile hero; her American imitator was bent on following her down fouler ways than this. But I feel that an apology is due to the virtuous memory of the chaste <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Aphra</persName>; she was indeed the first “nigger novelist,” and she was likewise a vendor and purveyor of obscene fiction; but here the parallel ends; for I am not aware that she ever applied her unquestionable abilities in that unlovely line of business to the defamation at second hand of the illustrious and defenceless dead.</note></p>
            <p>Thus much however we may safely assert: that no man’s work was ever more influenced by his character; and that no man’s character was ever more influenced by his circumstances. Rather from things without than from things within him did the spirit of Byron assume colour and shape. His noblest verse leapt on a sudden<pb n="241"/> into life after the heaviest evils had fallen upon him which even he ever underwent. From the beginning indeed he had much to fight against; and three impediments hung about him at starting, the least of which would have weighed down a less strong man: youth, and genius, and an ancient name.<note n="1">That his youth and his rank were flung in his face with vulgar insolence on the publication of his first little book it can hardly be necessary to remind any reader of Byron; but possibly even these offences might have been condoned in a scribbler whose work had given no offensive promise of greatness yet to be. In the verses on <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Lochnagar</persName> at least an ominous threat or presage of something new and splendid must have been but too perceptible to the discerning eye of criticism.</note> In spite of all three he made his way; and suffered for it. At the first chance given or taken, every obscure and obscene thing that lurks for pay or prey among the fouler shallows and thickets of literature flew against him; every hound and every hireling lavished upon him the loathsome tribute of their abuse; all nameless creatures that nibble and prowl, upon whom the serpent’s curse has fallen, to go upon his belly and eat dust all the days of his life, assailed him with their foulest venom and their keenest fangs. And the promise given of old to their kind was now at least fulfilled: they did bruise his heel. But the heads of such creatures are so small that it is hard to bruise them in return; it would first be necessary to discern them.</p>
            <p>That Byron was able to disregard and to outlive the bark and the bite of such curs as these is small praise enough: the man who cannot do as much is destructible and therefore contemptible. He did far more than this; he withstood the weight of circumstances to the end; <!--R--> <pb n="242"/> not always without complaint, but always without misgiving. His glorious courage, his excellent contempt for things contemptible, and hatred of hateful men, are enough of themselves to embalm and endear his memory in the eyes of all who are worthy to pass judgment upon him. And these qualities gave much of their own value to verse not otherwise or not always praiseworthy. Even at its best, the serious poetry of Byron is often so rough and loose, so weak in the screws and joints which hold together the framework of verse, that it is not easy to praise it enough without seeming to condone or to extenuate such faults as should not be overlooked or forgiven. No poet is so badly represented by a book of selections. It must show something of his weakness; it cannot show all of his strength. Often, after a noble overture, the last note struck is either dissonant or ineffectual. His magnificent masterpiece, which must endure for ever among the precious relics of the world, will not bear dissection or extraction. The merit of “<title>Don Juan</title>” does not lie in any part, but in the whole. There is in that great poem an especial and exquisite balance and sustenance of alternate tones which cannot be expressed or explained by tidal utmost ingenuity of selection. Haidée is supplanted by Dudù, the shipwreck by the siege, the Russian court by the English household; and this perpetual change, this tidal variety of experience and emotion, gives to the poem something of the breadth and freshness of the sea. Much of the poet’s earlier work is or seems unconsciously dishonest; this, if not always or wholly unaffected, is as honest as the sunlight, as frank as the sea-wind. Here, and here alone,<pb n="243"/> the student of his work may recognise and enjoy the ebb and flow of actual life. Here the pulse of vital blood may be felt in tangible flesh. Here for the first time the style of Byron is beyond all praise or blame: a style at once swift and supple, light and strong, various and radiant. Between “<title>Childe Harold</title>” and “<title>Don Juan</title>” the same difference exists which a swimmer feels between lakewater and sea-water: the one is fluent yielding, invariable; the other has in it a life and pulse, a sting and a swell, which touch and excite the nerves like fire or like music. Across the stanzas of “<title>Don Juan</title>” we swim forward as over “the broad backs of the sea”; they break and glitter, hiss and laugh, murmur and move, like waves that sound or that subside. There is in them a delicious resistance, an elastic motion, which salt water has and fresh water has not. There is about them a wide wholesome air, full of vivid light and constant wind, which is only felt at sea. Life undulates and death palpitates in the splendid verse which resumes the evidence of a brave and clear-sighted man concerning life and death. Here, as at sea, there is enough and too much of fluctuation and intermission; the ripple flags and falls in loose and lazy lines: the foam flies wide of any mark, and the breakers collapse here and there in sudden ruin and violent failure. But the violence and weakness of the sea are preferable to the smooth sound and equable security of a lake: its buoyant and progressive impulse sustains and propels those who would sink through weariness in the flat and placid shallows. There are others whom it sickens, and others whom it chills; these will do well to steer inshore. </p><!--R 2--><pb n="244"/>
                    <p>It is natural in writing of Byron to slide into remembrances of what is likest to his verse. His work and <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Shelley</persName>’s, beyond that of all our other poets, recall or suggest the wide and high things of nature; the large likeness of the elements; the immeasurable liberty and the stormy strength of waters and winds. They are strongest when they touch upon these; and it is worth remark how few are the poets of whom this can be said. Here, as elsewhere, <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Shakespeare</persName> is supreme when it pleased him; but it <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">pleased</persName> him rarely. No poetry of shipwreck and the sea has ever equalled the great scene of “<title>Pericle’s;</title>“no such note of music was ever struck out of the dash and contention of tempestuous elements. In Milton the sublimity is chiefly of sound; the majesty of melodies unsurpassed from all time well-nigh excludes and supplants all other motives of material beauty. In the minds of mediaeval poets there was no width or depth to receive and contain such emotion. In <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Spenser</persName>, despite his fertile and fluent ingenuity, his subtle and sleepy graces, the effeminacy of colour no less than the monotony of metre makes it hopeless to look for any trace of that passionate sense of power and delight in great outer things of which we speak here. Among later men, <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Coleridge</persName> and <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Keats</persName> used nature mainly as a  stimulant or a sedative; <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Wordsworth</persName> as a vegetable fit to shred into his pot and pare down like the outer leaves of a lettuce for didactic and culinary purposes.<note n="1"> I remember some critical cackling over this phrase when it first appeared as over a senseless insult offered to the name and genius of a great poet. Insult is no habit of mine; and the term here used implies no more than he that runs may read in the text of Wordsworth; in whom, after the somewhat early subsidence of that “simple, sensuous, and passionate” delight in nature of which in two of his most famous poems he has for ever embalmed his recollection, the place of this rapturous instinct of submission and absorption, which other poets have been who never have ceased to feel in sight of natural glory and beauty, was taken by a meditative and moralizing spirit too apt to express itself in the tone of a preacher to whom all the divine life of things outside man is but as raw material for philosophic or theological cookery. How far this method of contemplating and interpreting the splendours and terrors of nature differs from that of his greatest contemporaries it is surely neither irrelevant nor impertinent to point out once more. Wide apart as lay their lines of work, it is true alike of Shelley and of Keats that for them it was not fated, nor could it ever have been possible, to outlive

                nor could Byron, while retaining as did Wordsworth the freshness and the force of his genius, have outlived his more fiery delight in the triumphant life of sea and cloud and storm.</note>
                    All these<pb n="245"/> doubtless in their own fashion loved her, for her beauties, for her uses, for her effects; hardly one for herself.</p>
                    <p>Turn now to Byron or to Shelley. These two at least were not content to play with her skirts and paddle in her shallows. Their passion is perfect a fierce and blind desire which exalts and impels their verse into the high places of emotion and expression. They feed upon nature with a holy hunger follow her with a divine lust as of gods chasing the daughters of men. Wind and fire, the cadences of thunder and the clamours of the sea, gave to them no less of sensual pleasure than of spiritual sustenance. These things they desired as others desire music or wine or the beauty of women. This outward and indifferent nature of things, cruel in the eyes of all but her lovers, and even in theirs not loving, became as<pb n="246"/> pliant to their grasp and embrace as any <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Clymene</persName> or <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Leucothea</persName> to <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Apollo</persName>’s. To them the large motions and the remote beauties of space were tangible and familiar as flowers. Of this poetry, where description melts into passion and contemplation takes fire from delight, the highest sample is Shelley’s “<title>Ode to the West Wind.</title>” An imperfect mastery of his materials keeps the best things of Byron some few degrees below an equal rank One native and incurable defect grew up and strengthened side by side with his noblest qualities: a feeble and faulty sense of metre. No poet of equal or inferior rank ever had so bad an ear. His smoother cadences are often vulgar and facile; his fresher notes are often incomplete and inharmonious. His verse stumbles and jingles, stammers and halts, where there is most need for a swift and even pace of musical sound. The rough sonorous changes of the songs in the “<title>Deformed Transformed</title>” rise far higher in harmony and strike far deeper into the memory than the lax easy lines in which he at first indulged; but they slip too readily into notes as rude and weak as the rhymeless tuneless verse in which they are so loosely set, as in a cheap and casual frame. The magnificent lyric measures of “<title>Heaven and Earth</title>” are defaced by the coarse obtrusion of short lines with jagged edges: no small offence in a writer of verse. Otherwise these choral scenes are almost as blameless as they are brilliant. The poet who above others took delight in the sense of sounding storms and shaken waters could not but exult over the vision of deluge with all his strength and breadth of wing. Tempest and rebellion and the magnificence of anguish were as the natural food and fire <pb n="247"/> to kindle and sustain his indomitable and sleepless spirit. The godless martyrdom of rebels; the passion that cannot redeem; the <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Thebaid</persName> whose first hermit was <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Cain</persName>, the <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Calvary</persName> whose first martyr was <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Satan</persName>; these, time after time, allured and inspired him. Here for once this inner and fiery passion of thought found outer clothing and expression in the ruin of a world. Both without and within, the subject was made for him, and lay ready shapen for the strong impressure of his hand. His love of wide and tempestuous waters fills his work throughout as with the broad breath of a sea-wind. Even the weakest of his poems, a thing still-born and shapeless, is redeemed and revived by one glorious verse:— 
                <quote type="block" rendition="#block">“When the Poles crashed, and water was the world.”</quote></p>
            <p>This passion and power in dealing with the higher things of nature, with her large issues and remote sources, has been bestowed upon <title>Victor Hugo</title> alone among our contemporaries. He also can pass beyond the idyllic details of landscape, and put out from shore into the wide waste places of the sea. And this of course is the loftiest form of such poetry as deals with outward nature and depends upon the forms of things. In Byron the power given by this passion is the more conspicuous through his want of dramatic capacity. Except in the lighter and briefer scenes of “<title>Don Juan</title>,” he was never able to bring two speakers face to face and supply them with the right words. In structure as in metre his elaborate tragedies are wholly condemnable; filled as they are in spirit with the overflow of his fiery energy. “<title>Cain</title>” and “<title>Manfred</title>” are properly monologues decorated and set off <pb n="248"/> by some slight appendage of ornament or explanation. In the later and loftier poem there is no difference perceptible, except in strength and knowledge, between <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Lucifer</persName> and <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Cain</persName>. Thus incompetent to handle the mysteries and varieties of character, Byron turns always with a fresh delight and a fresh confidence thither where he feels himself safe and strong. No part of his nature was more profound and sincere than the vigorous love of such inanimate things as were in time with his own spirit and senses. His professions of contempt were too loud to express it; scorn is brief or silent; anger alone finds vent in violent iteration and clamorous appeal. He had too much of fury and not enough of contempt; he foams at things and creatures not worth a glance or a blow. But when once clear of men and confronted with elements, he casts the shell of pretence and drops the veil of habit; then, as in the last and highest passage of a poem which has suffered more from praise than any other from dispraise, his scorn of men caught in the nets of nature and necessity has no alloy of untruth; his spirit is mingled with the sea’s, and overlooks with a superb delight the ruins and the prayers of men. </p>
            <p>This loftiest passage in “<title>Childe Harold</title>” has been so often mouthed and mauled by vulgar admiration that it now can scarcely be relished. Like a royal robe worn out, or a royal wine grown sour, it seems the worse for having been so good. But in fact, allowing for one or two slips and blots, we must after all replace it among the choice and high possessions of poetry. After the first there is hardly a weak line; many have a wonderful vigour and melody; and the deep and glad disdain of <pb n="249"/> the sea for men and the works of men passes <sic>nto</sic><!--[SIC]--> the verse in music and fills it with a weighty and sonorous harmony grave and sweet as the measured voice of heavy remote waves. No other passage in the fourth canto will bear to be torn out from the text; and this one suffers by extraction. The other three cantos are more loosely built and less compact of fabric; but in the first two there is little to remember or to praise. Much of the poem is written throughout in falsetto; there is a savour in many places as of something false and histrionic. This singular and deep defect, which defaces so much of Byron’s work, seems also to have deformed his personal character to have given a twist to his enmities and left a taint upon his friendships. He was really somewhat sombre and sad at heart, and it pleased him to seem sadder than he was. He was impressible and susceptible to pleasure, able to command and enjoy it; and of this also it pleased him to make the most in public. But in fact he was neither a Harold nor a Juan; he was better than these in his own way, and assumed their parts and others with a hypocrisy but half insincere. The fault was probably in great part unconscious, and transparent as a child’s acting. To the keen eye and cool judgment of <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Stendhal</persName> it was at once perceptible. Byron’s letter to him in defence of Scott was doubtless not insincere; yet it is evident that the writer felt himself to be playing a graceful part to advantage. This fretful and petulant appetite for applause, the proper apanage of small poets and lowly aspirants, had in Byron’s case to wrestle with the just pride of place and dignity of genius; no man ever had more of these; yet <pb n="250"/> they did not always support him; he fell even into follies and vulgarities unworthy of a meaner name than his. In effect, when his errors were gravest, he erred through humility and not through pride. Pride would have sustained him far above the remarks and reviews of his day, the praise or dispraise of his hour. As it was, he was vulnerable even by creeping things; and at times their small stings left a poison behind which turned his blood. The contagion of their touch infected him; and he strove under its influence to hiss and wound as they. Here and there in his letters and reflections, in the loose records of his talk and light fragments of his work, the traces of infection are flagrant.</p>
                    <p>But these defects were only as scars on the skin, superficial and removable; they are past and done with;  while all of him that was true and good remains, as it will to all time. Justice cannot be done to it here or now. It is enough if after careful selection as little injustice be done as possible. His few sonnets, unlike <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Shelley</persName>’s, are all good; the best is that on <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Bonnivard</persName>, one of his noblest and completest poems. The versified narratives which in their day were so admirable and famous have yielded hardly a stray sheaf to the gleaner. They have enough of vigour and elasticity to keep life in them yet; but once chipped or broken their fabric would crumble and collapse. The finest among them is certainly either the “<title>Giaour</title>” or the “<title>Siege of Corinth</title>;” the weakest is probably either “<title>Parisina</title>” or the “<title>Bride of Abydos</title>.” But in none of these is there even a glimpse of Byron’s higher and rarer faculty. All that can be said for them is that they gave tokens of a talent singularly fertile, rapid <pb n="251"/> and vivid; a certain power of action and motion which redeems them from the complete stagnation of dead verses; a command over words and rhymes never of the best and never of the worst. In the “<title>Giaour</title>,” indeed there is something of a fiery sincerity which in its successors appears diluted and debased. <note n="1">Remembering the success of these stories, we may believe that Byron’s contempt for the critical fashions of a time which extolled his worst work was not wholly affected or assumed; and understand how the instincts of opposition and reaction drove him back into that open idolatry of <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Pope</persName> and his school which he expressed loudly and foolishly enough. Probably at heart he did really prefer Pope to all men. His critical faculty, if I may steal one phrase from a treasury that may well spare me the loan, was “zero, or even a frightful <hi rendition="#i">minus</hi> quantity;” his judgement never worth the expense of a thought or a word. Besides, he had striven to emulate or at least to copy the exquisite manner of Pope in his satires, and must have seen how great and impassable a gulf lay between the master and his pupil This would naturally lead him to over-estimate what he could not attain: the delicate merit, the keen perfection, the equable balance of force and finish, of sense and style, which raised his favourite so high among writers, if they left him somewhat low among poets; and having himself so bad an ear for metre, he may even have imagined that Pope’s verse was musical.</note></p> 
            <p>The change began in Byron when he first found out his comic power, and rose at once beyond sight or shot of any rival. His early satires are wholly devoid of humour, wit, or grace; the verse of “<title>Beppo</title>,” bright and soft and fluent, is full at once of all. The sweet light, music of its few and low notes was perfect as a prelude to the higher harmonies of laughter and tears, of scorn and passion, which as yet lay silent in the future. It is mere folly to seek in English or Italian verse a precedent or a parallel. The scheme of metre is Byron’s alone; no weaker hand than his could ever bend that bow, or <pb n="252"/> ever will. Even the Italian poets, working in a language more flexible and ductile than ours, could never turn their native metre to such uses, could never handle their national weapon with such grace and strength. The <foreign rendition="#i" xml:lang="it">terza rima</foreign> remains their own, after all our efforts to adapt it; it bears here only forced flowers and crude fruits; <note n="1">I do not of course forget that our own time has produced two noble poems in this foreign and alien metre; but neither “<title>Casa Guidi Windows</title>” nor “<title>The Defence of Guenevere</title>” will suffice to establish its general excellence or fitness. The poets have done so well because they could do no less; but there may be at once good material and good workmanship without good implements. Neither of them has done more to give footing in England to the metre of their poems than did Byron himself by his “<title>Prophecy of Dante</title>.” They have done better than this; but this they have not done.</note> but the <foreign rendition="#i" xml:lang="it">ottava rima</foreign> Byron has fairly conquered and wrested from them: Before the appearance of “<title>Beppo</title>” no one could foresee what a master’s hand might make of the instrument; and no one could predict its further use and its dormant powers before the advent of “<title>Don Juan</title>.” In the “<title>Vision of Judgment</title>” it appears finally perfected; the metre fits the sense as with close and pliant armour, the perfect panoply of <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Achilles</persName>. A poem so short and hasty, based on a matter so worthy of brief contempt and long oblivion as the funeral and the fate of <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">George III</persName>., bears about it at first sight no great sign or likelihood of life. But this poem which we have by us stands alone, not in Byron’s work only, but in the work of the world. Satire in earlier times had changed her rags for robes; <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Juvenal</persName> had clothed with fire, and <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Dryden</persName> with majesty, that wandering and bastard Muse. <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Byron</persName> gave her wings to fly with, above the reach even of these.<pb n="253"/> Others have had as much of passion and as much of humour; <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Dryden</persName> had perhaps as much of both combined. But here and not elsewhere a third quality is apparent: the sense of a high and clear imagination. The grave and great burlesque of <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">King George</persName> and <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">St. Peter</persName> is relieved and sustained by the figures of <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Michael</persName> and <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Satan</persName>. These two, confronted and corresponding as noon and night, lift and light up the background of satire, bloodred or black according to the point of view. Above all, the balance of thought and passion is admirable; human indignation and divine irony are alike understood and expressed: the pure and fiery anger of men at sight of wrong-doing, the tacit inscrutable derision of heaven. Upon this light and lofty poem a commentary might be written longer than the text and less worth reading; but here it shall not be. Those who read it with the due delight, not too gravely and not too lightly, will understand more than can now be set down; those who read it otherwise will not understand anything. Even these can hardly fail to admire the vigour and variety of scorn, the beauty and the bitterness of verse, which raise it beyond comparison with any other satire. There is enough and too much of violence and injustice in the lines on <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Southey</persName>; but it must be remembered that he was the first to strike, and with an unfair weapon. A poet by profession, he had assaulted with feeble fury another poet, not on the fair and open charge of bad verses, but under the impertinent and irrelevant plea that his work was an affliction or an offence to religion and morality—the most susceptible as the most intangible, among the creatures of metaphor. A man less irritable <pb n="254"/> and less powerful than Byron might be forgiven for any reprisals; and the excellence of his verses justifies their injustice. But that Southey, who could win and retain for life the love and the praise of <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Landor</persName>, was capable of conscious baseness or falsity, Byron himself in sober moments should hardly have believed. Between official adoration and not less official horror—between <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">George</persName> deified and Byron’s denounced—the Laureate’s position was grotesque enough. It was almost a good office to pelt him with the names of hireling and apostate; these charges he could reject and refute. The facts were surely sufficient: that, as to religion, his “present Deity” was the paltriest maniac among kings and <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Caesars</persName>; as to morality, his feelings or his faith obliged him to decry as pernicious the greatest work of his opponent.</p>
            <p>Side by side with the growth of his comic and satiric power, the graver genius of Byron increased and flourished. As the tree grew higher it grew shapelier; the branches it put forth on all sides were fairer of leaf and fuller of fruit than its earlier offshoots had promised. But from these hardly a stray bud or twig can be plucked off by way of sample. No detached morsel of “<title>Don Juan</title>,” no dismembered fragment of “<title>Cain</title>,” will serve to show or to suggest the excellence of either. These poems are coherent and complete as trees or flowers; they cannot be split up and parcelled out like a mosaic of artificial jewellery, which might be taken to pieces by the same artisan who put it together. It must then be remembered that any mere selection from the verse of Byron, however much of care and of goodwill be spent upon the task, must perforce either exclude or impair his very greatest work. <pb n="255"/> Cancel or select a leaf from these poems, and you will injure the whole framework equally in either case. It is not without reluctance that I have given any extracts from “<title>Don Juan</title>;” it is not without a full sense of the damage done to these extracts by the very act of extraction. But I could only have left them untouched with a reluctance even greater; and this plea, if it can, must excuse me. As fragments they are exquisite and noble, like the broken hand or severed foot of a Greek statue; but here as much is lost as there. Taken with their context, they regain as much of beauty and of force as the sculptured foot or hand when, reunited to the perfect body, they resume their place and office among its vital and various limbs. This gift of life and variety is the supreme quality of Byron’s chief poem; a quality which cannot be expressed by any system of extracts. Little can here be given beyond a sample or two of tragic and serious work. The buoyant beauty of surrounding verse, the “innumerable laughter” and the profound murmur of its many measures, the fervent flow of stanzas now like the ripples and now like the gulfs of the sea, can no more be shown by process of selection than any shallow salt pool left in the sand for sunbeams to drain dry can show the depth and length of the receding tide. </p>
            <p>It would be waste of words and time here to enlarge at all upon the excellence of the pure comedy of “<title>Don Juan.</title>” From the first canto to the sixteenth; from the defence of <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Julia</persName>, which is worthy of <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Congreve</persName> or <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Moliere</persName>, to the study of <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Adeline</persName>, which is worthy of <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Laclos</persName> or <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Balzac</persName>; the elastic energy of humour never falters or <pb n="256"/> flags. English criticism, with a mournful murmur of unanimous virtue, did at the time, and may yet if it please, appeal against the satire which strikes home and approve the satire that flies abroad. It was said, and perhaps is still said, that the poem falls off and runs low towards the end. Those who can discover where a change for the worse begins might at least indicate the landmark, imperceptible to duller eyes, which divides the good from the bad. Others meantime will retain their belief that this cry was only raised because in these latter cantos a certain due amount of satire fell upon the false and corrupt parts of English character, its mealy-mouthed vices and its unsound virtues. Had the scene been shifted to Italy or France, we might have heard little of the poet’s failing power and perverse injustice.</p>
            <p>It is just worth a word of notice that Byron, like <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Fielding</persName> before him, has caught up a well-known name and prefixed it to his work, without any attempt or desire to retain the likeness or follow the tradition attached to it. With him <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Don Juan</persName> is simply a man somewhat handsomer and luckier than others of his age. This hero is not even a reduced copy of the great and terrible figure with which he has nothing in common but a name. The <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Titan</persName> of embodied evil, the likeness of sin made flesh, which grew up in the grave and bitter imagination of a <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Spanish</persName> poet, steeped in the dyes and heated by the flames of hell, appears even in the hands of <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Moliere</persName> diminished, and fallen as it were from <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Satan</persName> to <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Belial</persName>: but still splendid with intellect and courage that tower above the meaner minds and weaker wills of women and of men; still inflexible to human appeal and indomitable<pb n="257"/> by divine anger. To crush him, heaven is compelled to use thunder and hell-fire; and by these, though stricken, he is not subdued. The sombre background of a funereal religion is not yet effaced; but it tasked the whole strength of Moliere, gigantic as that strength was, to grapple with the shadow of this giant, to transfigure upon a new stage the tragic and enormous incarnation of supreme sin. As it is, even when playing with his debtors or his peasants, the hero of Moliere retains always some feature of his first likeness, some shadow of his early shape. But further than France the terrible legend has never moved. Rigid criticism would therefore say that the title of Byron’s masterpiece was properly a misnomer: which is no great matter after all, since the new Juan can never be confounded with the old.</p>
            <p>Of Byron’s smaller poems there is less to say, and less space to say it. Their splendid merits and their visible defects call neither for praise nor blame. Their place and his, in the literature of England, are fixed points: no critical astronomy of the future can lower or can raise them: they have their own station for all time among the greater and the lesser stars. As a poet, Byron was surpassed, beyond all question and all comparison, by three men at least of his own time; and matched, if not now and then overmatched, by one or two others. The verse of <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Wordsworth</persName>, at its highest, went higher than his; the verse of <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Landor</persName> flowed clearer. But his own ground, where none but he set foot, was lofty enough, fertile and various. Nothing in Byron is so worthy of wonder and admiration as the scope and range of his power. New fields and ways of work, had he lived, might have given <!--S--><pb n="258"/> room for exercise and matter for triumph to “that most fiery spirit.” <note n="1">The noble verses of Shelley are fitter to be spoken over Byron than over any first or last Napoleon. To no other man could they be so well applied: for the world indeed took more of warmth from the fire of his spirit while alive than from any other then, kindled:—

                As it is, his work was done at <persName corresp="#unfamiliar">Missolonghi</persName>; all of his work for which the fates could spare him time. A little space was allowed him to show at least a heroic purpose, and attest a high design; then, with all things unfinished before him and behind, he fell asleep after many troubles and triumphs. Few can ever have gone wearier to the grave; none with less fear. He had done enough to earn his rest Forgetful now and set free for ever from all faults and foes, he passed through the doorway of no ignoble death out of reach of time, out of sight of love, out of hearing of hatred, beyond the blame of England and the praise of Greece. In the full strength of spirit and of body his destiny overtook him, and made an end of all his labours. He had seen and borne and achieved more than most men on record. “He was a great man, good at many things, and now he has attained this also, to be at rest”<pb n="60"/></p>
