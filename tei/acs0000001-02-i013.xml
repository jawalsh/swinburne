			<l n="23"> Was it Love brake forth flower-fashion, a bird with gold on his wings,<ptr target="#acs0000001-02-i013-note01"/>
			</l>
			<l n="24"> Lovely, her firstborn passion, and impulse of firstborn things?</l>
			<l n="25"> Was Love that nestling indeed that under the plumes of the night</l>
			<l n="26"> Was hatched and hidden as seed in the furrow, and brought forth bright?</l>
			<l n="27"> Was it Love lay shut in the shell world-shaped, having over him there</l>
			<l n="28"> Black world-wide wings that impel the might of the night through air?</l>
			<l n="29"> And bursting his shell as a bird, night shook through her sail-stretched
				vans,</l>
			<pb n="95" facs="acs0000001-02-110"/>
			<l n="30"> And her heart as a water was stirred, and its heat was the firstborn man's.</l>
			<l n="31"> For the waste of the dead void air took form of a world at birth,</l>
			<l n="32"> And the waters and firmaments were, and light, and the life-giving earth.</l>
			<l n="33"> The beautiful bird unbegotten that night brought forth without pain</l>
			<l n="34"> In the fathomless years forgotten whereover the dead gods reign,</l>
			<l n="35"> Was it love, life, godhead, or fate? we say the spirit is one</l>
			<l n="36"> That moved on the dark to create out of darkness the stars and the sun.</l>
			<l n="37"> Before the growth was the grower, and the seed ere the plant was sown;</l>
			<l n="38"> But what was seed of the sower? and the grain of him, whence was it grown?</l>
			<l n="39"> Foot after foot ye go back and travail and make yourselves mad;</l>
			<l n="40"> Blind feet that feel for the track where highway is none to be had.</l>
			<l n="41"> Therefore the God that ye make you is grievous, and gives not aid,</l>
			<l n="42"> Because it is but for your sake that the God of your making is made.</l>
			<l n="43"> Thou and I and he are not gods made men for a span,</l>
			<l n="44"> But God, if a God there be, is the substance of men which is man.</l>
			<l n="45"> Our lives are as pulses or pores of his manifold body and breath;</l>
			<l n="46"> As waves of his sea on the shores where birth is the beacon of death.</l>
			<pb n="96" facs="acs0000001-02-111"/>
			<l n="47"> We men, the multiform features of man, whatsoever we be,</l>
			<l n="48"> Recreate him of whom we are creatures, and all we only are he.</l>
			<l n="49"> Not each man of all men is God, but God is the fruit of the whole;</l>
			<l n="50"> Indivisible spirit and blood, indiscernible body from soul.</l>
			<l n="51"> Not men's but man's is the glory of godhead, the kingdom of time,</l>
			<l n="52"> The mountainous ages made hoary with snows for the spirit to climb.</l>
			<l n="53"> A God with the world inwound whose clay to his footsole clings;</l>
			<l n="54"> A manifold God fast-bound as with iron of adverse things.</l>
			<l n="55"> A soul that labours and lives, an emotion, a strenuous breath,</l>
			<l n="56"> From the flame that its own mouth gives reillumed, and refreshed with death.</l>
			<l n="57"> In the sea whereof centuries are waves the live God plunges and swims;</l>
			<l n="58"> His bed is in all men's graves, but the worm hath not hold on his limbs.</l>
			<l n="59"> Night puts out not his eyes, nor time sheds change on his head;</l>
			<l n="60"> With such fire as the stars of the skies are the roots of his heart are fed.</l>
			<l n="61"> Men are the thoughts passing through it, the veins that fulfil it with blood,</l>
			<l n="62"> With spirit of sense to renew it as springs fulfilling a flood.</l>
			<l n="63"> Men are the heartbeats of man, the plumes that feather his wings,</l>
			<pb n="97" facs="acs0000001-02-112"/>
			<l n="64"> Storm-worn, since being began, with the wind and thunder of things.</l>
			<l n="65"> Things are cruel and blind; their strength detains and deforms:</l>
			<l n="66"> And the wearying wings of the mind still beat up the stream of their storms.</l>
			<l n="67"> Still, as one swimming up stream, they strike out blind in the blast,</l>
			<l n="68"> In thunders of vision and dream, and lightnings of future and past.</l>
			<l n="69"> We are baffled and caught in the current and bruised upon edges of shoals;</l>
			<l n="70"> As weeds or as reeds in the torrent of things are the wind-shaken souls.</l>
			<l n="71"> Spirit by spirit goes under, a foam-bell's bubble of breath,</l>
			<l n="72"> That blows and opens in sunder and blurs not the mirror of death.</l>
			<l n="73"> For a worm or a thorn in his path is a man's soul quenched as a flame;</l>
			<l n="74"> For his lust of an hour or his wrath shall the worm and the man be the same.</l>
			<l n="75"> O God sore stricken of things! they have wrought him a raiment of pain;</l>
			<l n="76"> Can a God shut eyelids and wings at a touch on the nerves of the brain?</l>
			<l n="77"> O shamed and sorrowful God, whose force goes out at a blow!</l>
			<l n="78"> What world shall shake at his nod? at his coming what wilderness glow?</l>
			<l n="79"> What help in the work of his hands? what light in the track of his feet?</l>
			<l n="80"> His days are snowflakes or sands, with cold to consume him and heat.</l>
			<pb n="98" facs="acs0000001-02-113"/>
			<l n="81"> He is servant with Change for lord, and for wages he hath to his hire</l>
			<l n="82"> Folly and force, and a sword that devours, and a ravening fire.</l>
			<l n="83"> From the bed of his birth to his grave he is driven as a wind at their will;</l>
			<l n="84"> Lest Change bow down as his slave, and the storm and the sword be still;</l>
			<l n="85"> Lest earth spread open her wings to the sunward, and sing with the spheres;</l>
			<l n="86"> Lest man be master of things, to prevail on their forces and fears.</l>
			<l n="87"> By the spirit are things overcome; they are stark, and the spirit hath
				breath;</l>
			<l n="88"> It hath speech, and their forces are dumb; it is living, and things are of
				death.</l>
			<l n="89"> But they know not the spirit for master, they feel not force from above,</l>
			<l n="90"> While man makes love to disaster, and woos desolation with love.</l>
			<l n="91"> Yea, himself too hath made himself chains, and his own hands plucked out his
				eyes;</l>
			<l n="92"> For his own soul only constrains him, his own mouth only denies.</l>
			<l n="93"> The herds of kings and their hosts and the flocks of the high priests bow</l>
			<l n="94"> To a master whose face is a ghost's; O thou that wast God, is it thou?</l>
			<l n="95"> Thou madest man in the garden; thou temptedst man, and he fell;</l>
			<l n="96"> Thou gavest him poison and pardon for blood and burnt-offering to sell.</l>
			<l n="97"> Thou hast sealed thine elect to salvation, fast locked with faith for the
				key;</l>
			<pb n="99" facs="acs0000001-02-114"/>
			<l n="98"> Make now for thyself expiation, and be thine atonement for thee.</l>
			<l n="99"> Ah, thou that darkenest heaven — ah, thou that bringest a sword —</l>
			<l n="100"> By the crimes of thine hands unforgiven they beseech thee to hear them, O
				Lord.</l>
			<l n="101"> By the balefires of ages that burn for thine incense, by creed and by rood,</l>
			<l n="102"> By the famine and passion that yearn and that hunger to find of thee food,</l>
			<l n="103"> By the children that asked at thy throne of the priests that were fat with
				thine hire</l>
			<l n="104"> For bread, and thou gavest a stone; for light, and thou madest them fire;</l>
			<l n="105"> By the kiss of thy peace like a snake's kiss, that leaves the soul rotten at
				root;</l>
			<l n="106"> By the savours of gibbets and stakes thou hast planted to bear to thee
				fruit;</l>
			<l n="107"> By torture and terror and treason, that make to thee weapons and wings;</l>
			<l n="108"> By thy power upon men for a season, made out of the malice of things;</l>
			<l n="109"> O thou that hast built thee a shrine of the madness of man and his shame,</l>
			<l n="110"> And hast hung in the midst for a sign of his worship the lamp of thy name;</l>
			<l n="111"> That hast shown him for heaven in a vision a void world's shadow and shell,</l>
			<l n="112"> And hast fed thy delight and derision with fire of belief as of hell;</l>
			<l n="113"> That hast fleshed on the souls that believe thee the fang of the death-worm
				fear,</l>
			<l n="114"> With anguish of dreams to deceive them whose faith cries out in thine ear;</l>
			<pb n="100" facs="acs0000001-02-115"/>
			<l n="115"> By the face of the spirit confounded before thee and humbled in dust,</l>
			<l n="116"> By the dread wherewith life was astounded and shamed out of sense of its
				trust,</l>
			<l n="117"> By the scourges of doubt and repentance that fell on the soul at thy nod,</l>
			<l n="118"> Thou art judged, O judge, and the sentence is gone forth against thee, O
				God.</l>
			<l n="119"> Thy slave that slept is awake; thy slave but slept for a span;</l>
			<l n="120"> Yea, man thy slave shall unmake thee, who made thee lord over man.</l>
			<l n="121"> For his face is set to the east, his feet on the past and its dead;</l>
			<l n="122"> The sun rearisen is his priest, and the heat thereof hallows his head.</l>
			<l n="123"> His eyes take part in the morning; his spirit outsounding the sea</l>
			<l n="124"> Asks no more witness or warning from temple or tripod or tree.</l>
			<l n="125"> He hath set the centuries at union; the night is afraid at his name;</l>
			<l n="126"> Equal with life, in communion with death, he hath found them the same.</l>
			<l n="127"> Past the wall unsurmounted that bars out our vision with iron and fire</l>
			<l n="128"> He hath sent forth his soul for the stars to comply with and suns to
				conspire.</l>
			<l n="129"> His thought takes flight for the centre wherethrough it hath part in the
				whole;</l>
			<l n="130"> The abysses forbid it not enter: the stars make room for the soul.</l>
			<l n="131"> Space is the soul's to inherit; the night is hers as the day;</l>
			<pb n="101" facs="acs0000001-02-116"/>
			<l n="132"> Lo, saith man, this is my spirit; how shall not the worlds make way?</l>
			<l n="133"> Space is thought's, and the wonders thereof, and the secret of space;</l>
			<l n="134"> Is thought not more than the thunders and lightnings? shall thought give
				place?</l>
			<l n="135"> Is the body not more than the vesture, the life not more than the meat?</l>
			<l n="136"> The will than the word or the gesture, the heart than the hands or the feet?</l>
			<l n="137"> Is the tongue not more than the speech is? the head not more than the crown?</l>
			<l n="138"> And if higher than is heaven be the reach of the soul, shall not heaven bow
				down?</l>
			<l n="139"> Time, father of life, and more great than the life it begat and began,</l>
			<l n="140"> Earth's keeper and heaven's and their fate, lives, thinks, and hath
				substance in man.</l>
			<l n="141"> Time's motion that throbs in his blood is the thought that gives heart to
				the skies,</l>
			<l n="142"> And the springs of the fire that is food to the sunbeams are light to his
				eyes.</l>
			<l n="143"> The minutes that beat with his heart are the words to which worlds keep
				chime,</l>
			<l n="144"> And the thought in his pulses is part of the blood and the spirit of time.</l>
			<l n="145"> He saith to the ages, Give; and his soul foregoes not her share;</l>
			<l n="146"> Who are ye that forbid him to live, and would feed him with heavenlier air?</l>
			<l n="147"> Will ye feed him with poisonous dust, and restore him with hemlock for
				drink,</l>
			<l n="148"> Till he yield you his soul up in trust, and have heart not to know or to
				think?</l>
			<pb n="102" facs="acs0000001-02-117"/>
			<l n="149"> He hath stirred him, and found out the flaw in his fetters, and cast them
				behind;</l>
			<l n="150"> His soul to his soul is a law, and his mind is a light to his mind.</l>
			<l n="151"> The seal of his knowledge is sure, the truth and his spirit are wed;</l>
			<l n="152"> Men perish, but man shall endure; lives die, but the life is not dead.</l>
			<l n="153"> He hath sight of the secrets of season, the roots of the years and the
				fruits;</l>
			<l n="154"> His soul is at one with the reason of things that is sap to the roots.</l>
			<l n="155"> He can hear in their changes a sound as the conscience of consonant spheres;</l>
			<l n="156"> He can see through the years flowing round him the law lying under the
				years.</l>
			<l n="157"> Who are ye that would bind him with curses and blind him with vapour of
				prayer?</l>
			<l n="158"> Your might is as night that disperses when light is alive in the air.</l>
			<l n="159"> The bow of your godhead is broken, the arm of your conquest is stayed;</l>
			<l n="160"> Though ye call down God to bear token, for fear of you none is afraid.</l>
			<l n="161"> Will ye turn back times, and the courses of stars, and the season of souls?</l>
			<l n="162"> Shall God's breath dry up the sources that feed time full as it rolls?</l>
			<l n="163"> Nay, cry on him then till he show you a sign, till he lift up a rod;</l>
			<l n="164"> Hath he made not the nations to know him of old if indeed he be God?</l>
			<l n="165"> Is no heat of him left in the ashes of thousands burnt up for his sake?</l>
			<pb n="103" facs="acs0000001-02-118"/>
			<l n="166"> Can prayer not rekindle the flashes that shone in his face from the stake?</l>
			<l n="167"> Cry aloud; for your God is a God and a Saviour; cry, make yourselves lean;</l>
			<l n="168"> Is he drunk or asleep, that the rod of his wrath is unfelt and unseen?</l>
			<l n="169"> Is the fire of his old loving-kindness gone out, that his pyres are acold?</l>
			<l n="170"> Hath he gazed on himself unto blindness, who made men blind to behold?</l>
			<l n="171"> Cry out, for his kingdom is shaken; cry out, for the people blaspheme;</l>
			<l n="172"> Cry aloud till his godhead awaken; what doth he to sleep and to dream?</l>
			<l n="173"> Cry, cut yourselves, gash you with knives and with scourges, heap on to you
				dust;</l>
			<l n="174"> Is his life but as other gods' lives? is not this the Lord God of your
				trust?</l>
			<l n="175"> Is not this the great God of your sires, that with souls and with bodies was
				fed,</l>
			<l n="176"> And the world was on flame with his fires? O fools, he was God, and is dead.</l>
			<l n="177"> He will hear not again the strong crying of earth in his ears as before,</l>
			<l n="178"> And the fume of his multitudes dying shall flatter his nostrils no more.</l>
			<l n="179"> By the spirit he ruled as his slave is he slain who was mighty to slay,</l>
			<l n="180"> And the stone that is sealed on his grave he shall rise not and roll not
				away.</l>
			<l n="181"> Yea, weep to him, lift up your hands; be your eyes as a fountain of tears;</l>
			<l n="182"> Where he stood there is nothing that stands; if he call, there is no man
				that hears.</l>
			<pb n="104" facs="acs0000001-02-119"/>
			<l n="183"> He hath doffed his king's raiment of lies now the wane of his kingdom is
				come;</l>
			<l n="184"> Ears hath he, and hears not; and eyes, and he sees not; and mouth, and is
				dumb.</l>
			<l n="185"> His red king's raiment is ripped from him naked, his staff broken down;</l>
			<l n="186"> And the signs of his empire are stripped from him shuddering; and where is
				his crown?</l>
			<l n="187"> And in vain by the wellsprings refrozen ye cry for the warmth of his sun —</l>
			<l n="188"> O God, the Lord God of thy chosen, thy will in thy kingdom be done.</l>
			<l n="189"> Kingdom and will hath he none in him left him, nor warmth in his breath;</l>
			<l n="190"> Till his corpse be cast out of the sun will ye know not the truth of his
				death?</l>
			<l n="191"> Surely, ye say, he is strong, though the times be against him and men;</l>
			<l n="192"> Yet a little, ye say, and how long, till he come to show judgment again?</l>
			<l n="193"> Shall God then die as the beasts die? who is it hath broken his rod?</l>
			<l n="194"> O God, Lord God of thy priests, rise up now and show thyself God.</l>
			<l n="195"> They cry out, thine elect, thine aspirants to heavenward, whose faith is as
				flame;</l>
			<l n="196"> O thou the Lord God of our tyrants, they call thee, their God, by thy name.</l>
			<l n="197"> By thy name that in hell-fire was written, and burned at the point of thy
				sword,</l>
			<l n="198"> Thou art smitten, thou God, thou art smitten; thy death is upon thee, O
				Lord.</l>
			<l n="199"> And the love-song of earth as thou diest resounds through the wind of her
				wings —</l>
			<l n="200"> Glory to Man in the highest! for Man is the master of things.</l>
