		<l n="1"><hi rendition="#sc">Light</hi> and night, whose clouds and glories change and mingle and divide,</l>
	<l n="2">Veil the truth whereof they witness, show the truth of things they hide.</l>
	<l n="3">Through the darkness and the splendour of the centuries, loud or dumb,</l>
	<l n="4">Shines and wanes and shines the spirit, lit with love of life to come.</l>
	<l n="5">Man, the soul made flesh, that knows not death from life, and fain would know,</l>
	<l n="6">Sees the face of time change colour as its tides recoil and flow.</l>
	<l n="7">All his hope and fear and faith and doubt, if aught at all they be,</l>
	<l n="8">Live the life of clouds and sunbeams, born of heaven or earth or sea.</l>
	<l n="9">All are buoyed and blown and brightened by their hour's evasive breath:</l>
	<l n="10">All subside and quail and darken when their hour is done to death.</l>
	<l n="11">Yet, ere faith, a wandering water, froze and curdled into creeds,</l>
	<l n="12">Earth, elate as heaven, adored the light that quickens dreams to deeds.</l>
    <pb n="304" facs="acs0000001-06-321"/>
	<l n="13">Invisible: eye hath not seen it, and ear hath not heard as the spirit hath heard</l>
	<l n="14">From the shrine that is lit not of sunlight or starlight the sound of a limitless word.</l>
	<l n="15">And visible: none that hath eyes to behold what the spirit must perish or see</l>
	<l n="16">Can choose but behold it and worship: a shrine that if light were as darkness would be.</l>
	<l n="17">Of cloud and of change is the form of the fashion that man may behold of it wrought:</l>
	<l n="18">Of iron and truth is the mystic mid altar, where worship is none but of thought.</l>
	<l n="19">No prayer may go up to it, climbing as incense of gladness or sorrow may climb:</l>
	<l n="20">No rapture of music may ruffle the silence that guards it, and hears not of time.</l>
	<l n="21">As the winds of the wild blind ages alternate in passion of light and of cloud,</l>
	<l n="22">So changes the shape of the veil that enshrouds it with darkness and light for a shroud.</l>
	<l n="23">And the winds and the clouds and the suns fall silent, and fade out of hearing or sight,</l>
	<l n="24">And the shrine stands fast and is changed not, whose likeness was changed as a cloud in the night.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
	<l n="25" rendition="#ti-1">All the storms of time, and wrath of many winds, may carve no trace</l>
	<l n="26" rendition="#ti-1">On the viewless altar, though the veil bear many a name and face:</l>
	<l n="27" rendition="#ti-1">Many a live God's likeness woven, many a scripture dark with awe,</l>
	<l n="28" rendition="#ti-1">Bids the veil seem verier iron than the word of life's own law.</l>
    <pb n="305" facs="acs0000001-06-322"/>
	<l n="29" rendition="#ti-1">Till the might of change hath rent it with a rushing wind in twain,</l>
	<l n="30" rendition="#ti-1">Stone or steel it seems, whereon the wrath of chance is wreaked in vain:</l>
	<l n="31" rendition="#ti-1">Stone or steel, and all behind it or beyond its lifted sign</l>
	<l n="32" rendition="#ti-1">Cloud and vapour, no subsistence of a change-unstricken shrine.</l>
	<l n="33" rendition="#ti-1">God by god flits past in thunder, till his glories turn to shades:</l>
	<l n="34" rendition="#ti-1">God to god bears wondering witness how his gospel flames and fades.</l>
	<l n="35" rendition="#ti-1">More was each of these, while yet they were, than man their servant seemed:</l>
	<l n="36" rendition="#ti-1">Dead are all of these, and man survives who made them while he dreamed.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
	<l n="37">Yet haply or surely, if vision were surer than theirs who rejoiced that they saw,</l>
	<l n="38">Man might not but see, through the darkness of godhead, the light that is surety and law.</l>
	<l n="39">On the stone that the close-drawn cloud which veils it awhile makes cloudlike stands</l>
	<l n="40">The word of the truth everlasting, unspoken of tongues and unwritten of hands.</l>
	<l n="41">By the sunbeams and storms of the centuries engraven, and approved of the soul as it reads,</l>
	<l n="42">It endures as a token dividing the light from the darkness of dreams and of deeds.</l>
	<l n="43">The faces of gods on the face of it carven, or gleaming behind and above,</l>
	<l n="44">Star-glorified Uranus, thunderous Jehovah, for terror or worship or love,</l>
    <pb n="306" facs="acs0000001-06-323"/>
	<l n="45">Change, wither, and brighten as flowers that the wind of eternity sheds upon time,</l>
	<l n="46">All radiant and transient and awful and mortal, and leave it unmarred and sublime.</l>
	<l n="47">As the tides that return and recede are the fears and the hopes of the centuries that roll,</l>
	<l n="48">Requenched and rekindled: but strong as the sun is the sense of it shrined in the soul.</l>

	<l n="50">Ere sorrow had life to lot, ere earth gave thanks for the sun,</l>
	<l n="51">Ere man in his darkness waking adored what the soul in him could,</l>
	<l n="52">And the manifold God of his making was manifest evil and good,</l>
	<l n="53">One law from the dim beginning abode and abides in the end,</l>
	<l n="54">In sight of him sorrowing and sinning with none but his faith for friend.</l>
	<l n="55">Dark were the shadows around him, and darker the glories above,</l>
	<l n="56">Ere light from beyond them found him, and bade him for love's sake love.</l>
	<l n="57">About him was darkness, and under and over him darkness: the night</l>
	<l n="58">That conceived him and bore him had thunder for utterance and lightning for light.</l>
	<l n="59">The dust of death was the dust of the ways that the tribes of him trod:</l>
    <pb n="307" facs="acs0000001-06-324"/>
	<l n="60">And he knew not if just or unjust were the might of the mystery of God.</l>
	<l n="61">Strange horror and hope, strange faith and unfaith, were his boon and his bane:</l>
	<l n="62">And the God of his trust was the wraith of the soul or the ghost of it slain.</l>
	<l n="63">A curse was on death as on birth, and a Presence that shone as a sword</l>
	<l n="64">Shed menace from heaven upon earth that beheld him, and hailed him her Lord.</l>
	<l n="65">Sublime and triumphant as fire or as lightning, he kindled the skies,</l>
	<l n="66">And withered with dread the desire that would look on the light of his eyes.</l>
	<l n="67">Earth shuddered with worship, and knew not if hell were not hot in her breath;</l>
	<l n="68">If birth were not sin, and the dew of the morning the sweat of her death.</l>
	<l n="69">The watchwords of evil and good were unspoken of men and unheard:</l>
	<l n="70">They were shadows that willed as he would, that were made and unmade by his word.</l>
	<l n="71">His word was darkness and light, and a wisdom that makes men mad</l>
	<l n="72">Sent blindness upon them for sight, that they saw but and heard as he bade.</l>
	<l n="73">Cast forth and corrupt from the birth by the crime of creation, they stood</l>
	<l n="74">Convicted of evil on earth by the grace of a God found good.</l>
	<l n="75">The grace that enkindled and quickened the darkness of hell with flame</l>
	<l n="76">Bade man, though the soul in him sickened, obey, and give praise to his name.</l>
    <pb n="308" facs="acs0000001-06-325"/>
	<l n="77">The still small voice of the spirit whose life is as plague's hot breath</l>

	<l n="81">Yea, not nay, was the word: and the sacrifice offered withal</l>
	<l n="82">Was neither of beast nor of bird, but the soul of a man, God's thrall.</l>
	<l n="83">And the word of his servant spoken was fire, and the light of a sword,</l>
	<l n="84">When the bondage of Israel was broken, and Sinai shrank from the Lord.</l>
	<l n="85">With splendour of slaughter and thunder of song as the sound of the sea</l>

	<l n="87">Terror and trust and the pride of the chosen, approved of his choice,</l>

	<l n="89">Subdued and exalted and kindled and quenched by the sense of his might,</l>

	<l n="93">The chant of the prophetess, louder and loftier than tempest and wave,</l>

	<l n="95">And sweet as the moon's word spoken in smiles that the blown clouds mar</l>
	<l n="96">The psalmist's witness in token arose as the speech of a star.</l>
	<l n="97">Starlight supreme, and the tender desire of the moon, were as one</l>
	<l n="98">To rebuke with compassion the splendour and strength of the godlike sun.</l>
	<l n="99">God softened and changed: and the word of his chosen, a fire at the first,</l>
	<l n="100">Bade man, as a beast or a bird, now slake at the springs his thirst.</l>
	<l n="101">The souls that were sealed unto death as the bones of the dead lie sealed</l>
	<l n="102">Rose thrilled and redeemed by the breath of the dawn on the flame-lit field.</l>
	<l n="103">The glories of darkness, cloven with music of thunder, shrank</l>
	<l n="104">As the web of the word was unwoven that spake, and the soul's tide sank.</l>
	<l n="105">And the starshine of midnight that covered Arabia with light as a robe</l>
	<l n="106">Waxed fiery with utterance that hovered and flamed through the whirlwind on Job.</l>
	<l n="107">And prophet to prophet and vision to vision made answer sublime,</l>
	<l n="108">Till the valley of doom and decision was merged in the tides of time.</l>

	<l n="160">The word that sweetens and lightens her creed for her great love's sake.</l>
	<l n="161">From the godlike heart of Theresa the prayer above all prayers heard,</l>
	<l n="162">The cry as of God made woman, a sweet blind wonderful word,</l>
	<l n="163">Sprang sudden as flame, and kindled the darkness of faith with love,</l>
	<l n="164">And the hollow of hell from beneath shone, quickened of heaven from above.</l>
    <pb n="313" facs="acs0000001-06-330"/>
	<l n="165">Yea, hell at her word grew heaven, as she prayed that if God thought well</l>
	<l n="166">She there might stand in the gateway, that none might pass into hell.</l>
	<l n="167">Not Hermes, guardian and guide, God, herald, and comforter, shed</l>
	<l n="168">Such lustre of hope from the life of his light on the night of the dead.</l>
	<l n="169">Not Pallas, wiser and mightier in mercy than Rome's God shone,</l>
	<l n="170">Wore ever such raiment of love as the soul of a saint put on.</l>
	<l n="171">So blooms as a flower of the darkness a star of the midnight born,</l>
	<l n="172">Of the midnight's womb and the blackness of darkness, and flames like morn.</l>
	<l n="173">Nor yet may the dawn extinguish or hide it, when churches and creeds</l>
	<l n="174">Are withered and blasted with sunlight as poisonous and blossomless weeds.</l>
	<l n="175">So springs and strives through the soil that the legions of darkness have trod,</l>
	<l n="176">From the root that is man, from the soul in the body, the flower that is God.</l>

	<l n="209">Since man, with a child's pride proud, and abashed as a child and afraid,</l>
	<l n="210">Made God in his likeness, and bowed him to worship the Maker he made,</l>
	<l n="211">No faith more dire hath enticed man's trust than the saint's whose creed</l>
	<l n="212">Made Caiaphas one with Christ, that worms on the cross might feed.</l>
	<l n="213">Priests gazed upon God in the eyes of a babe new-born, and therein</l>
	<l n="214">Beheld not heaven, and the wise glad secret of love, but sin.</l>
	<l n="215">Accursed of heaven, and baptized with the baptism of hatred and hell,</l>
	<l n="216">They spat on the name they despised and adored as a sign and a spell.</l>
	<l n="217">
		<q next="#de77f2446">Lord Christ, thou art God, and a liar: they were children of wrath, not of grace,</q></l>

	<l n="219">Of such is the kingdomâhe said itâof heaven: and the heavenly word</l>
	<l n="220">Shall live when religion is dead, and when falsehood is dumb shall be heard.</l>
	<l n="221">And the message of James and of John was as Christ's and as love's own call:</l>
	<l n="222">But wrath passed sentence thereon when Annas replied in Paul.</l>
	<l n="223">The dark old God who had slain him grew one with the Christ he slew,</l>
	<l n="224">And poison was rank in the grain that with growth of his gospel grew.</l>

	<l n="225">And the blackness of darkness brightened: and red in the heart of the flame</l>

	<l n="227">Through centuries of burning and trembling belief as a signal it shone,</l>
	<l n="228">Till man, soul-sick of dissembling, bade fear and her frauds begone.</l>
	<l n="229">God Cerberus yelps from his throats triune: but his day, which was night,</l>

	<l n="231">The flames of its fires and the psalms of their psalmists are darkened and dumb:</l>
	<l n="232">Strong winter has withered the palms of his angels, and stricken them numb.</l>
	<l n="233">God, father of lies, God, son of perdition, God, spirit of ill,</l>
	<l n="234">Thy will that for ages was done is undone as a dead God's will.</l>
	<l n="235">Not Mahomet's sword could slay thee, nor Borgia's or Calvin's praise:</l>

	<l n="238">Rings now as the thunders of Jewry, the ghost of a dead world's tale.</l>
	<l n="239">That day and its doom foreseen and foreshadowed on earth, when thou,</l>
	<l n="240">Lord God, wast lord of the keen dark season, are sport for us now.</l>
	<l n="241">Thy claws were clipped and thy fangs plucked out by the hands that slew</l>

	<l n="248">Bade France and the world be wise, faith saw thee naked and shamed.</l>
	<l n="249">When wisdom deeper and sweeter than Rabelais veiled and revealed</l>
	<l n="250">Found utterance diviner and meeter for truth whence anguish is healed,</l>
	<l n="251">Whence fear and hate and belief in thee, fed by thy grace from above,</l>
	<l n="252">Fall stricken, and utmost grief takes light from the lustre of love,</l>
	<l n="253">When Shakespeare shone into birth, and the world he beheld grew bright,</l>
	<l n="254">Thy kingdom was ended on earth, and the darkness it shed was light.</l>
	<l n="255">In him all truth and the glory thereof and the power and the pride,</l>
	<l n="256">The song of the soul and her story, bore witness that fear had lied.</l>
	<l n="257">All hope, all wonder, all trust, all doubt that knows not of fear,</l>
	<l n="258">The love of the body, the lust of the spirit to see and to hear,</l>

	<l n="265">His word with the word of the lord most high of us all on earth,</l>

	<l n="270">When wisdom and light were one, and the hands of the matricide pure,</l>
	<l n="271">A song too subtle for psalmist or prophet of Jewry to know,</l>
	<l n="272">Elate and profound as the calmest or stormiest of waters that flow,</l>
	<l n="273">A word whose echoes were wonder and music of fears overcome,</l>
	<l n="274">Bade Sinai bow, and the thunder of godhead on Horeb be dumb.</l>
	<l n="275">The childless children of night, strong daughters of doom and dread,</l>
    <pb n="319" facs="acs0000001-06-336"/>
	<l n="276">The thoughts and the fears that smite the soul, and its life lies dead,</l>
	<l n="277">Stood still and were quelled by the sound of his word and the light of his thought,</l>
	<l n="278">And the God that in man lay bound was unbound from the bonds he had wrought.</l>
	<l n="279">Dark fear of a lord more dark than the dreams of his worshippers knew</l>
