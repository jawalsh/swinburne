<l>Yea, I loathe Hugh. Peter he beat, and meâ</l> 
<l>Me twice, because that day the <rs type="person">queen</rs> came in</l> 
<l>I twisted back my head to thrust well through</l> 
<l>The carved workâs double lattice to get sight</l> 
<l>Of a tall woman with gold clothes and hair</l> 
<l>That shone beyond her clothes; so sharp he smote,</l> 
<l>The grim beast Hugh with boarish teeth and hair</l> 
<l>All his chin long and where no hair should be!</l> 
<l>And Peter pinched and pushed all vespers through</l> 
<l>To get my turn and see her. How she went</l> 
<l>Holding her throat up, with her round neck out</l> 
<l>Curdwhite, no clot in it not smooth to strokeâ</l> 
<l>All night I shook in sleep for that one thing,</l> 
<l>Stirred with my feet and pulled about awry.</l>
  
  <pb n="267" facs="acs0000002-01-284"/>
  
<l>I think too she kept smiling with her mouth</l> 
<l>(Her wonderful red quiet mouth) and prayed</l> 
<l>All to herself. Now that men call a mouthâ</l> 
<l>And Hughâs begrimed big lips you call the same</l> 
<l>That make a thick smile up with all their fat</l> 
<l>Never but when he gets one by the nape</l> 
<l>To make him sprawl and weep. How all the hair</l> 
<l>Drew the hard shining of the candle-fires</l> 
<l>And shone back harder with a flare in it</l> 
<l>Through all the plaits and bands. Then Hugh saidââLook,</l> 
  <l>You <persName>Arthur</persName>, that white woman with such eyes</l> 
<l>Is worse in hell than any devil that seethes;</l> 
<l>She keeps the colour of it in her hair</l> 
<l>That shakes like flame so. Wait till I get in</l> 
<l>And teach the beastâs will in your female flesh</l> 
<l>With some red slits in it, to get out loose</l> 
<l>In such dogâs ways.â But Hugh lied hard, I think;</l> 
<l>For he said after in his damned side-room</l> 
<l>What fierce account God made of such a name</l> 
<l>And how the golden <rs type="person">king</rs> that made God songs</l> 
<l>Chid at their ways and called them this and that;</l> 
<l>And he loved many queens with just such hair</l> 
<l>And such good eyes, and had more scores of them</l> 
<l>Than I have stripes since last red week on me.</l> 
<l>So I can see Hugh lied. For no Jewâs wife</l> 
<l>Looked ever so, or found such ways to hold</l> 
<l>Her sweet straight body.âBut my nextâthatâs hard.</l>

<l>But am I good that kiss your lips or no?</l> 
<l>That keeps yet sweet; there is not so much pain</l> 
<l>As one might weep for; a little makes us weep;</l> 
<l>To die grown old were sad, but I die worth</l>

<l>Ay, keep the mouth at ease; shut down the lids;</l> 
<l>You see I am not riotously moved,</l> 
<l>But peaceable, all heat gone out of me.</l> 
<l>This is some trick, some riddle of a dream,</l> 
<l>Have you not known such dreams? I bid you stand,</l> 
<l>Being <rs type="person">king</rs> and lord, I make you come and go;</l> 
<l>But say I bid my love turn and kiss me,</l> 
<l>No more obedience? here at sight of her</l> 
<l>The heart of rule is broken. No more obedience?</l> 
<l>She hath forgotten this; were I a man,</l> 
<l>Even that would slay me; I beseech you, sir,</l> 
<l>Take no care of me; I can bid you; see,</l> 
<l>I touch her face; the lips begin to stir,</l> 
<l>Gather up colour; is there sound or speech,</l> 
<l>Or pleasant red under the white of death?</l> 
<l>She will speak surely; for dead flesh is grey</l> 
<l>And even the goodliest pattern wrought of man</l> 
<l>Coldness and change disfigure; what was red</l> 
<l>A new disconsolate colour overpaints,</l> 
<l>And ever with some ill deformity</l> 
<l>The secret riddle and pure sense of flesh</l> 
<l>Becomes defeated and the rebel taste</l> 
<l>Makes new revolt at it; I pray take note of me,</l> 
<l>Here comes no new thing; do you not see her face,</l> 
<l>How it hath shut up close like any flower,</l> 
<l>With scents of sleep and hesitating sweet</l> 
<l>Iâthe heaviest petal of it? Note her eyes,</l> 
<l>They move and alter; and if I touched her lips</l> 
<l>(Which lest she wake I will not) they would be</l> 
<l>As red as mine; yea that pure cheek of hers</l> 
<l part="I">Turn redder.</l>

<l>Sir, pardon me, I know she is but dead,</l> 
<l>She is not as I am; we have sense and soul;</l> 
<l>Who smites me on the mouth or plucks by the hair,</l> 
<l>I know what feels it; stab me with a knife,</l> 
<l>I can show blood: and when the eyes turn wet,</l> 
<l>Thereâs witness for me and apparent proof</l> 
<l>I am no less than man; though in the test</l> 
<l>I show so abject and so base a slave</l> 
<l>As grooms may snarl at, and your stabled hound</l> 
<l>Find place more worth preferment. For the <rs type="person">queen</rs>,</l> 
<l>See how strong laughter takes her by the throat</l> 
<l>And plucks her lips! her teeth would bite, no doubt,</l> 
<l>But she keeps quiet; she should live indeed;</l> 
<l>She hath mere motion, and such life in her</l> 
<l>Accuses and impeaches the Lord God,</l> 
<l>Who wrought so miserably the shapes of man</l> 
<l>With such sad cunning. Lo you, sir, she weeps;</l> 
<l>Now see I well how vile a thing it is</l> 
<l>To wear the label and the print of life</l> 
<l>Being fashioned so unhappily; for we</l> 
<l>Share no more sense nor worthier scope of time</l> 
<l>Than the live breath that is in swine and apes</l> 
<l>As honourable, now she that made us right</l> 
<l>In the keen balance and sharp scale of God</l> 
<l>Becomes as pasture and gross meat for death,</l> 
<l>Whereon the common ravin of his throat</l>
  
  <pb n="288" facs="acs0000002-01-305"/>
  
<l>Makes rank invasion. Time was, I could not speak</l> 
<l>But she would praise or chide me; now I talk</l> 
<l>All this time out, mere baffled waste, to get</l> 
<l>That word of her I find not. Tell me, sweet,</l> 
<l>Have I done wrong to thee? spoken thee ill?</l> 
  <l>Nay, for scorn hurts me, <persName>Rosamond</persName>; be wise,</l> 
<l>As I am patient; do but bow your faceâ</l> 
<l>By God she will not! Abide you but awhile</l> 
<l>And we shall hear her; for she will not fail.</l> 
<l>She will just turn her sweet head quietly</l> 
<l>And kiss me peradventure; say no word,</l> 
<l>And you shall see her; doubtless she will grow</l> 
<l>Sorry to vex me; see now, here are two</l> 
<l>She hath made weep, and God would punish her</l> 
<l>For hardness, ay though she were thrice as fair,</l> 
<l>He would not love her; look, she would fain wake,</l> 
<l>It makes her mouth move and her eyelids rise</l> 
<l>To feel so near me.âAy, no wiser yet?</l> 
<l>Then will I leave you; maybe she will weep</l> 
<l>To have her hands made empty of me; yea,</l> 
<l>Lend me your hand to cover close her face,</l> 
<l>That she may sleep well till we twain be gone;</l> 
<l>Cover the mouth up; come each side of me.</l>
