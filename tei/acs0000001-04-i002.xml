                     violent imagery suggests Poseidon is the god referred to here.

                     phrase "this man dead" presumably refers to Plexippus. In lines
                     1595-96 below, Althaea refers to "this man too, / Dead, with my
                     son's spear thrust between his sides," which matches the Herald's
                     description of how Toxeus was killed. So this first man dead must be
                     Plexippus.</note>
