                     <p> In ancient Greece, a female follower of Bacchus, traditionally
                        associated with divine possession and frenzied rites. These were typically
                        upper-class women, who, every other winter, go up into the Greek mountains
                        to perform a ritual urged by Dionysus. </p>

					<l n="701">And as a tune before a great king played</l>
					<l n="702">For triumph was the tune their strong strokes made,</l>

					<pb n="35" facs="acs0000001-04-046"/>
					<l n="705">For all the loud breach of the waves at will.</l>

					<l n="708">The keel sprang from the wave-ridge, and the sky</l>

					<l n="710">Then the bows with a sharp shock plunged again</l>
					<l n="711">Down, and the sea clashed on them, and so rose</l>
					<l n="712">The bright stem like one panting from swift blows,</l>
					<l n="713">And as a swimmer's joyous beaten head</l>
					<l n="714">Rears itself laughing, so in that sharp stead</l>
					<l n="715">The light ship lifted her long quivering bows</l>
					<l n="716">As might the man his buffeted strong brows</l>
					<l n="717">Out of the wave-breach; for with one stroke yet</l>
					<l n="718">Went all men's oars together, strongly set</l>
					<l n="719">As to loud music, and with hearts uplift</l>
					<l n="720">They smote their strong way through the drench and drift:</l>

					<l n="723">Tired; and across the thin and slackening rain</l>

					<l n="133">Might aught of all things hearten him save one,</l>
					<l n="134">Faith: and as men's eyes quail before the sun</l>
					<l n="135">So quailed his heart before the star whose light</l>
					<l n="136">Put out the torches of his bridal night,</l>

					<l n="144">Where lay the lonely lily-featured flower</l>

					<l n="149">That wife indeed might never be, to wear</l>

					<l n="152">When time should change, with hand more soft than snow,</l>

					<l n="165">Within the chamber, heavy-eyed: and there</l>

					<l n="167">That might but move his memory more of one more fair,</l>
					<l n="168">More fair than all this beauty: but in sooth</l>
					<l n="169">So fair she too shone in her flower of youth</l>

					<l n="171">Though strong, who gazed upon her: for her eyes</l>
					<l n="172">Were emerald-soft as evening-coloured skies,</l>
					<l n="173">And a smile in them like the light therein</l>
					<l n="174">Slept, or shone out in joy that knew not sin,</l>
					<l n="175">Clear as a child's own laughter: and her mouth,</l>
					<l n="176">Albeit no rose full-hearted from the south</l>
					<l n="177">And passion-coloured for the perfect kiss</l>
					<l n="178">That signs the soul for love and stamps it his,</l>
					<l n="179">Was soft and bright as any bud new-blown;</l>

					<l n="182">So in her bride-bed lay the bride: and he</l>
					<l n="183">Drew nigh, and all the high sad heart in him</l>
					<l n="184">Yearned on her, seeing the twilight meek and dim</l>
					<l n="185">Through all the soft alcove tremblingly lit</l>
					<l n="186">With hovering silver, as a heart in it</l>
					<pb n="74" facs="acs0000001-04-085"/>
					<l n="187">Beating, that burned from one deep lamp above,</l>
					<l n="188">Fainter than fire of torches, as the love</l>
					<l n="189">Within him fainter than a bridegroom's fire,</l>
					<l n="190">No marriage-torch red with the heart's desire,</l>
					<l n="191">But silver-soft, a flameless light that glowed</l>
					<l n="192">Starlike along night's dark and starry road</l>
					<l n="193">Wherein his soul was traveller. And he sighed,</l>
					<l n="194">Seeing, and with eyes set sadly toward his bride</l>
					<l n="195">Laid him down by her, and spake not: but within</l>
					<l n="196">His heart spake, saying how sore should be the sin</l>

					<l n="27">For love the red, for hope the gentle green,</l>
					<l n="28">But yellow jealousy glared pale between.</l>
					<l n="29">Ere yet the sky grew heavier, and her head</l>
					<l n="30">Bent flowerwise, chill with change and fancies fled,</l>
					<l n="31">She saw but love arch all her heaven across with red,</l>
					<l n="32">A burning bloom that seemed to breathe and beat</l>
					<l n="33">And waver only as flame with rapturous heat</l>
					<l n="34">Wavers; and all the world therewith smelt sweet,</l>
					<l n="35">As incense kindling from the rose-red flame:</l>
					<l n="36">And when that full flush waned, and love became</l>
					<l n="37">Scarce fainter, though his fading horoscope</l>
					<l n="38">From certitude of sight receded, hope</l>
					<l n="39">Held yet her April-coloured light aloft</l>
					<l n="40">As though to lure back love, a lamp sublime and soft.</l>
					<l n="41">But soon that light paled as a leaf grows pale</l>
					<l n="42">And fluttered leaf-like in the gathering gale</l>
					<l n="43">And melted even as dew-flakes, whose brief sheen</l>
					<l n="44">The sun that gave despoils of glittering green;</l>
					<l n="45">Till harder shone 'twixt hope and love grown cold</l>
					<l n="46">A sallow light like withering autumn's gold,</l>
					<l n="47">The pale strong flame of jealous thought, that glows</l>
					<l n="48">More deep than hope's green bloom or love's enkindled rose:</l>
					<l n="49">As though the sunflower's faint fierce disk absorbed</l>
